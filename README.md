# URL Filter tester 

*This program was developed as part of my Capstone project to test the URL filtering ability of a firewall. 

-After user input, the program launches the URLs, test whether or not it gets through, reports the errors and check the firewall log for the entries. 
-XML parsed log in then printed onto the output text alongside the program results. 
-The outputs are stored in a folder with the start time of the program included in the filename. 
-The program also checks for invalid user inputs and create a separate file containing the errors in the outputs folder. 
-I have removed the links to the firewall from the uploaded version.
